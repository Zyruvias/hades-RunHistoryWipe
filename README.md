# hades-RunHistoryWipe
Mod for Hades by SuperGiant Games that wipes run history to prevent savefile hitching. Saves speed/heat records per aspect. To use, install (requires SGG `modimporter.py`, ModUtil, and HadesSpeedrunningModpack), enter game, visit the mod QoL menu page, and hit the reset button 5 times while in the House of Hades. Text should pop up over Zagreus's head saying your run history has been wiped.

NOTE: THIS IS PERMANENT - ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR OLD SAVE FILES JUST IN CASE.
